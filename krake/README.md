Krake [ˈkʀaːkə] is an orchestrator engine for containerized and virtualized
workloads across distributed and heterogeneous cloud platforms. It creates a
thin layer of aggregation on top of the different platforms (such as OpenStack,
Kubernetes or OpenShift) and presents them through a single interface to the
cloud user. The user's workloads are scheduled depending on both user
requirements (hardware, latencies, cost) and platforms characteristics (energy
efficiency, load). The scheduling algorithm can be optimized for example on
latencies, cost, or energy.
Krake can be leveraged for a wide range of application scenarios such as
central management of distributed compute capacities as well as application
management in Edge Cloud infrastructures.
