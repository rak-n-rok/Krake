def run(command, retry=10, interval=1, condition=None):
    """Runs a subprocess

    This function runs the provided ``command`` in a subprocess.

    Tests are typically subjects to race conditions. We frequently have to
    wait for an object to reach a certain state (RUNNING, DELETED, ...)

    Therefore, this function implements a retry logic:

    - The ``condition`` callable takes the command's response as argument and
      checks if it suits a certain format.
    - The ``retry`` and ``interval`` arguments control respectively the number
      of retries the function should attempt before raising an
      `AssertionError`, and the number of seconds to wait between each retry.

    The signature of ``condition`` is:

    .. function:: my_condition(response)

        :param Response response: The command response.
        :raises AssertionError: Raised when the condition is not met.

    Note that is doesn't make sense to provide a ``condition`` without a
    ``retry``. One should rather test this condition in the calling function.

    Args:
        command (list): The command to run
        retry (int, optional): Number of retry to perform. Defaults to 10
        interval (int, optional): Interval in seconds between two retries
        condition (callable, optional): Condition that has to be met.

    Returns:
        Response: The output and return code of the provided command

    Raises:
        AssertionError: Raise an exception if the ``condition`` is not met.

    Example:
        .. code:: python

            import util

            # This condition will check if the command has a null return
            # value
            def check_return_code(error_message):

                def validate(response):
                    assert response.returncode == 0, error_message

                return validate

            # This command has a risk of race condition
            some_command = "..."

            # The command will be retried 10 time until the command is
            # successful or will raise an AssertionError
            util.run(
                some_command,
                condition=check_return_code("error message"),
                retry=10,
