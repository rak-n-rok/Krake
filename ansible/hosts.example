# Ansible inventory for Krake
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a standard Ansible YAML repository with a custom inventory plugin.
# The only customization sidecar JSON file storing inferred information of
# OpenStack resources, e.g. UUIDs, public and private IP addresses. The
# location of this file can be configured by specifying the "hosts_file"
# variable in the "all" group. If it is not specified it defaults to
# ".etc/<inventory-filestem>.json".
#
# The "krake_inventory" plugin works exactly like the standard YAML inventory
# plugin except that it loads the JSON file defined by "hosts_file" and
# augments the host variables with "dynamic" variables depending on
# OpenStack.
plugin: krake_inventory

    # (~/.ssh/id_rsa) will be used.
